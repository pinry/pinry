# Theories

Our general thought process for why we have implemented features the way we
have.

## Boards & Tags

Boards are for overall themes and tags are for specification. An example of this
is "Cars" and "Car Types". A board could be "Cars" and then some tags on a pin
in that board would be "Mustang", "Sports Car", "Sedan", etc.

You would also like to share pins via "board" (designed only for a single user) 
instead of "tag" which designed for all users.
