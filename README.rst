Requirements
------------

Pinry is built on top of Django and optimized to run on a Linux
environment. However we have gotten Pinry to work on Windows and Mac as
well but it may require some extra digging around configuration. Pinry's
Python requirements are all in the ``Pipfile`` file. You can easily install
these using pipenv, to get pipenv, if you already have Python and pip, run
python ``pip install pipenv``.


Testing
-------

We have many tests built into Pinry to ensure that changes don't break
anything. If you are live dangerously and have cutting edge new Pinry
features first you can use our master branch for your own instance. We
recommend using our tags/versions though.

To run Pinry's tests inside the Pinry repo run::

    pipenv install --dev --three
    pipenv run python manage.py test


Docker
------

Follow the steps below to install Pinry locally or on any server. This
process installs the minimal requirements to run Pinry. For development
requirements and procedures, see testing above.

Current docker configuration will just mount source code directory to
docker app directory and run any codes existed in current git branch,
you may also add "local_settings.py" to customize settings without
changing settings file in `pinry/settings`.

- Install the requirements:
    - Docker
    - Docker Compose

- Set any custom configuration options you need and run::

    cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
    # edit docker-compose.yml and change the secret-key,
    # don't forget to backup this config file.
    docker-compose up -d

- If you want to run Pinry with current user in docker::

    ./start_docker_with_current_user.sh [-d]

- Bootstrap the database(optional)::

    docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py migrate --settings=pinry.settings.docker


Linting
-------

So everything isn't a mess::

    pipenv run flake8 --exclude=migrations
